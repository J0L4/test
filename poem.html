<h1>We want to take away the pain </h1>

<p id=p2>You can see the pain all over their faces.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Look them in the eyes,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>And you see a reflection of their soul that shatters,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Now there is only one thing that matters.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>In every part of their bodies,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>In every little bit of flesh that remains,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>You can see that they are hurt almost enough not to breathe.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Loosing strength even in the protection from their myelin of their brains.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>As if the gray matter of the regime got too dark,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>To tell the right way from the wrong apart.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Wherefore the innocent get hurt by the once that should protect them.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>They fight for the good,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>More than anything to save a life that’s worth to live,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Wanting to be understood.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Helping to take away the pain,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Like cars get washed from the rain.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>We can’t be the saviour they need on earth,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>But turning our back on them,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>It will only get worth.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Clouds are no longer the only thing passing,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Honestly we have to start confessing.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Running from flames that turn their world into dust,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Like iron gets destroyed by rust,</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>It's people who make their world hell and break their trust.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>And are still not stopped with their reputation.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>So that everyone starts looking for another destination.</p id=p2>
<p id=p2>Just to take away the pain. </p id=p2>
